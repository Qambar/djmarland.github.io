title: My Gospel of Web Development
---

<h2>Last update: 23rd July 2015</h2>
This page details my personal beliefs of how to build websites. These are my rules of web development
and I believe them strongly. I will defend them with passion *but* am always open to listen and observe
new techniques and technologies. When I hear a new argument I like, I will adapt it into my beliefs and
working practices, then update this page accordingly.
