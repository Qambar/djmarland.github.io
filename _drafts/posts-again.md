title: "Posting Again"

You'll notice a four year gap between posts here.

I originally had a blog, but pretty much all I put on it were snippets of code where I had worked
out a solution I couldn't find by searching.

It turns out two of them were particuarly popular. My
<a href="/cross-browser-alpha-transparent-background-10-2011/">Cross browser alpha transparent background CSS (rgba)</a>
post from October 2011 was especially much more popular than I anticipated, due to being linked on
Stack Overflow.

When I consolidated my hosting and websites, I shut down <a href="http://hammerspace.co.uk">hammerspace.co.uk</a>,
which was where my blog was hosted. I still love the phrase
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerspace">hammerspace</a> though, so I'm reluctant to relinquish the
domain. One day I might do something awesome with it, but if you really want it for something amazing
get in touch.

I pulled my personal website, which was basically just a contact page, onto
<a href="http://rland.me.uk">rland.me.uk</a> and removed the need to pay for hosting by using github pages.

Github supports <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/">Jekyll</a> as a
static site generator, so I could still have a blog with posts. I ported over the two most popular posts,
and threw away the other two that nobody ever read (yeah I barely posted).

I messed up the redirects from the old URLs (something I really dislike) as it turned out Namecheap didn't
offer deep level redirects. This actually resulted in me recieving e-mails from several people who relied
on my <a href="/cross-browser-alpha-transparent-background-10-2011/">Alpha transparency</a> post on a daily
basis. I now have a poor substitute provided by jekyll which doesn't use a 301 status code.
However hearing from readers directly was nice, and I was able to direct them to the new location.
My code examples will now use <a href="http://codepen.io/djmarland/">Codepen</a>
so hopefully it's easier for anyone who relies on an example to fork a local copy and be sure they've always
got it.

Anyway, what this comes down to, is I now have a website that is hosted how I want, and I can still write
posts when I want to. The next challenge is getting into the habit of writing posts. The longer I've worked
in this industry, the more confident I've got in my opinions. So now I'm just have to get into the habit
of writing frequently.

Let's see how that goes.
