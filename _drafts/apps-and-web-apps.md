There are too many apps for things that shouldn't have apps. If you're just wrapping your website data
in an app then it's questionable whether the app needs to exist. This is especially true if a user is
unlikely to visit your site/app on a regular basis. An app should justify itself by:
<ul>
    <li>Truly needing a spot on the homescreen (regular re-use)</li>
    <li>High performance/graphics (i.e. games)</li>
    <li>Offline usage (stored tracks)</li>
    <li>Notifications</li>
    <li>more...</li>
</ul>
The web is gaining some more of these capabilities (WebGL / Service Worker), which will be valuable
in some scenarios to enhance the web. But there are some things that apps handle better, such as
Music/Podcast/Audiobook Players, Instant Messengers, Games.

<h3>Web apps</h3>
There is a certain class of web development which is for Web Apps. A Web App doesn't rely on the document
structure of a normal web document and they are not expected to have to function as a raw HTML document.

A web app is NOT a website. Sources of articles and general information suchs as Blogs,
Store information, News etc, have no business been built as a "Web app". A web app is an interactive
tool, where the user has a specific task to perform. In some cases they may be handled better
as a proper app. However, the web offers universal access so it is valuable to have these tools on
the web, even if they are not "in" it. An example might be a ticketing website. Searching for tickets
and finding information about events should definitely not be built as a "Web App". It should be publically
accessible and crawable data. However, once the user decides to purchase there may be tasks they
need to perform, such as adding their information, uploading and ID photo, choosing a seat etc.
This section, once the user has crossed the threshold, will absolutely be a better experience built
as an interactive "web app", and should NOT require a native app to do so.
