title: "My Gospel of Web Development"
---

Like many professionals in industry (especially if you're on LinkedIn) I am occasionally approached
by recruiters (or headhunters as they sometimes like to call themselves).

Many times there will be outright lies saying they've seen my work, or articles, and would then offer
me a role I should obviously have no interest in. For example, telling me there is an Angular role
that is perfect for me would anger me rather than encourage me.

There are many ways to work in web development, and every web developer is different. Therefore I feel
it's important for me to declare how I work and what I believe in.

I have therefore added a new <a href="/beliefs/">page of beliefs</a> to my website. This details all
my current working practices and processes I believe in. As a developer I will evangelise these beliefs
to others strongly. However, they are not set in stone. I will, and have, evolved my beliefs when
something new comes along to take its place. This does not happen lightly however. I will not jump
onto the latest bandwagon. I will observe and evaluate, maybe even experiment.

<h2>Strong opinions, weakly held</h2>
I value these beliefs strongly, and they are my preferred way of working. But I can be convinced to change.
The <a href="/beliefs/">page of beliefs</a> purposely has a last updated date on it. It should be an
evolving document as times and opinions change. Change is necessary to remain relevant in the world
of the web, though it must be well informed change.


Is this a good practice to have? If not, let me know; though I may take some convincing.
